    ========== Notes ===========================================================

    1. Image navigation rules:
        a. You must use the original navigation of the image in order to calculate parallax.
        b. Archer can calcuate parallax from a subsection (line and/or element) of a geo image
            or conical scan. However, to calculate parallax of crosstrack scans, Archer must have 
            a subsection with full lines (all the elements of the line). 
        c. Conical scans are expected to default to the format that is found in their Level 1B
            files, which is rows = lines and cols = elements. 
        d. *** Cross-track scans are expected to default to the opposite format, as found in *their*
            Level 1B files, which is rows = elements and cols = lines. For example, a grid of 
            ATMS data is expected to have 96 rows always, VIIRS DNB data is expected to have 
            4064 rows always, etc.
        e. The one exception to all this is if you include image['azm_grid'] and image['zen_grid'] 
            as inputs. Then archer can calculate parallax on any projection or subsection.


    2. attrib['sat']: Name of the satellite. This is not *yet* used in Archer, but may be
        necessary in the future. Follow the GeoIPS rules for satellite naming.


    3. attrib['sensor']: One of the following:
        For conical microwave sensors: ['SSMI', 'SSMIS', 'TMI', 'GMI', 'AMSRE', 'AMSR2']
        For crosstrack microwave sensors: ['AMSUB', 'MHS', 'ATMS']
        For polar imagers: ['VIIRS'] (Add AVHRR?)
        For geo imagers: ['Imager']


    4. attrib['archer_channel_type']: One of these valid strings: ['37GHz', '89GHz', '183GHz',
        'IR', 'SWIR', 'Vis', 'DNB']
        Used for directing channel-specific logic in archer.


    5. first_guess['source']: One of these strings:
        'fx': Forecast
        'bt': Best track
        'manual': Manual estimate
        'archer': Previous archer estimate
        'NHCfxan': Splice of NHC-generated analysis and forecast track
        This variable is for nothing yet, but it may be needed in the future.
